  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    I graduated from Arizona State University's Barrett, The Honors College in May 2024 with a B.S. in Media Arts and Sciences with a concentration in 
    media processing. The major focused on crafting innovative digital media while encouraging critical thinking about how culture, society, and 
    technology intertwine. I gained hands-on experience in sound, video, and other immersive media systems with the cultural skills to apply them 
    meaningfully. My coursework gave me a strong foundation in creating, producing, and publishing multimedia projects. The media processing 
    concentration complemented my core classes with computer science coursework which taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My academic background has 
    equipped me with skills in graphic design, media production, and web development.

  <h2>Audio Projects</h2>
  <p>
    Below are some of my favorite audio projects that I have worked on. 
    These projects showcase my skills in sound design, podcasting, and audio editing.
  </p>

  <!--First Project-->
  <h4>Morning Park Medley - Sound Design Project</h4>
  <p>
    This goal of this project was to manipulate field recordings to create a melodic souundscape.
    I conducted field recordings at daybreak in a local park and used Reaper to edit and layer the sounds
    to compose a medley. I used various effects and techniques to enhance the sounds and create a cohesive piece.

  <h4>Chasing Cherry Blossoms Podcast</h4>

    This podcast uses conversations with Japanese Americans to explore what lessons we can learn by studying
    the past. I produced episodes 1, 2, and 6 specifically.

  <!--Third Project-->
  <h4>College 101 Podcast</h4>
    <p>
      This podcast was my Barrett Honors Thesis and Senior Capstone project. The goal of the podcast was to show that 
      the "stereotypical" college experience is not the only college experience. In each episode, I interviewed
      a different college student about their unique college experience. I created and produced this podcast
      completely on my own, from the initial concept to the final product, using Adobe Audition for editing.

  <!--Second Project-->
  <h4>Cactus Sunset</h4>
    <p>
      I created this photo by layering three different photos: a sun setting behind a mountain, a cactus landscape,
      and a starry night sky. I used Adobe Photoshop to blend the images together, manipulating the opacity of each layer,
      to create the effect of a sun setting in front of a row of cacti while the night sky begins to descend.

  <p>
    Below are some of my favorite graphic design projects that I have worked on. 
    These projects showcase my skills in logo design, branding, and product design.
  </p>

  <!--First Project-->
  <h4>U of A Logo Parody</h4>
    <p>
      As an ASU student, I thought it would be fun to spoof our rival school's logo into an ASU logo. 
      I wanted to keep the base recognizable as the U of A logo but change the elements to make it 
      ASU branded. I imported the raster image of the logo into Adobe Illustrator and converted it
      into a vector image. I used the pen tool to trace over the original logo and rearrange 
      the letters. I changed the colors to match ASU's branding and added the a gold pitchfork in the
      middle of the A.
  </p>

  <!--Second Project-->
  <h4>DoubleTree New Logo</h4>
    <p>
      This was a logo redesign project for DoubleTree by Hilton using Canva. The goal was to modernize the logo
      while keeping the core elements that make it recognizable. I wanted to keep the tree as the 
      main element of the logo but make it more stylized and contemporary. I used a sans-serif font
      for the text to give it a cleaner look. I also changed the color scheme to a more muted palette
      to give it a more sophisticated feel.
  </p>

  <!--Third Project-->
  <h4>Energy Drink Design</h4>
    <p>
      This project was a class assignment to create a new product and design a label for it using Adobe Illustrator.
      I created a sports smoothie drink brand called "NRG" and designed a label for two different flavors.
